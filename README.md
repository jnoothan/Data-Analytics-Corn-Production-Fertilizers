USA - Corn Harvesting, Production & Fertilizer Consumption



ğŸŒ¾ Analyzing Trends in USA Agriculture (1980-2022) ğŸ“Š



1. Planted and Harvested Acres:

ğŸ“ˆ Highest Planted Year: 2012 - 97 million acres, with 87 million acres harvested.

ğŸ“‰ Lowest Planted Year: 1983 - 60 million acres, with 51 million acres harvested.

ğŸ“‰ Steep downfall in 1983, with a 20 million acre difference compared to 1982.

ğŸ”„ Gradual downturn every 4-5 years after sudden increases.

ğŸŒ½ 7.8 million acres unharvested annually, 74.3 million acres harvested on average (90.3% efficiency).

ğŸ“‰ Highest Unharvested Acres: 1983 - 11.1 million acres.

ğŸ”— Strong positive correlation between planted and harvested acres.

ğŸ“ˆ Highest Harvested Percentage: 2007 - 92.5%.

ğŸ“‰ Least Harvested Percentage: 1983 - 85.5%.



2. Production Insights (1980-2022):

ğŸ“ˆ Consecutive increase from 6.6 to 14.5 billion Bushels on average.

ğŸ“‰ Least Production: 1983 - 4.2 billion Bushels.

ğŸ“ˆ Highest Production: 2016 and 2021 - 15.1 billion Bushels each.

ğŸ“‰ Steep 4 billion Bushels drop in 1983.

ğŸ”„ 3-4 billion Bushels fluctuation every 3-4 years.

ğŸ”„ High variance in 1992 - 9.5 billion Bushels to 6.3 billion Bushels in 1993, increased to 10.1 billion Bushels in 1994, then dropping to 7.4 billion Bushels in 1995.



3. Nitrogen Demand Analysis (1980-2022):

ğŸ“ˆ Nitrogen usage increases with plantation area.

ğŸ”— Strong correlation between plantation area and nitrogen usage.

ğŸ”„ Increase and decrease in usage during 1992, 1994, and 1993, 1995 respectively.

ğŸ“ˆ Significant increase from 1995 onwards.

ğŸ”— Strong positive correlation between plantation and nitrogen usage.

ğŸ”— 8-10% increase in usage every 5 years.



4. Fertilizer Application on Corn (1990-2003):

ğŸ’¹ Total Amounts Applied:Nitrogen - 138.27 Billion pounds

Phosphorus - 75.56 Billion pounds

Potassium - 126.39 Billion pounds



5. Nitrogen Use Related to Production (1990-2003):

ğŸ”— Positive correlation between production and nitrogen usage.

ğŸ“ˆ 10% growth in nitrogen usage (1990-2003) correlates with increased production.

ğŸ”„ Increase in efficiency: 9.2 Billion pounds used for 7.9 Billion Bushels in 1990 compared to 10.1 Billion pounds used for 10.3 Billion Bushels in 2003.

ğŸ“ˆ Highest Consumption: 2000 - 10.6 Billion pounds for 9.9 Billion Bushels.

ğŸ“‰ Least Consumption: 1995 - 9 Billion pounds for 7.4 Billion Bushels.



ğŸŒ¾ Conclusion:

Understanding the historical trends in planted acres, production, nitrogen usage, and fertilizer application provides valuable insights for optimizing agricultural practices. The positive correlations underscore the interconnectedness of various factors, guiding informed decisions for sustainable and efficient farming.
